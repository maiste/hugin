# Hugin Documentation

## What is Hugin ?

Hugin is a rest API that aims to serve JSON files from a server, easily.
It can be run into a container. The purpose is also to provide a Rust
version of the project `Hyperion` to improve the performance of the
service.

This server is used by the `Eos` project, the header manager.
